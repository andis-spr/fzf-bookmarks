# fzf-bookmarks

A simple solution for website bookmarks management.

## Features

- Query and select multiple bookmarks for opening in a web browser.

- Manage entire bookmarks collection from your favorite text editor.

- Made to run from within a macOS, Linux and Windows command line interface.

## Incentive

I realized I wanted a dead simple search tool and plaintext storage for my bookmarks outside of the browser after growing tired with the clunky browser UIs and their weird everchanging storage formats.

## Requirements

- lua
- fzf
- sed, awk, cat

On Windows you can install these packages using package "scoop.sh" package manager OR manually download the binaries for these tools and place them in the right folders as /dep-bin-win/{package}.
