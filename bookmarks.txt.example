Each bookmark is a single line that should be formatted as follows (without the preceding whitespace):
 #  website title (required)  ~  address (also required)  ~  website description  ~  comma-space-separated tags
e.g.
 #  50 Watts  ~  http://50watts.com/  ~  Illustration and book art with a literary bent. Focus on international illustrated books and Surrealism.  ~  visual arts, inspiration, illustration, archive

Bookmark lines begin with "#  " (hash, space x2) character sequence.
Lines like this will be shown in terminal by fuzzy finder.
Anything else, such as these comments and blank lines, is excluded from the search.

Bookmark line column separator is "  ~  " (space x2, tilde, space x2) character sequence.
First two columns (website title, address") are required.
